  # #4 The first validation executes if password_digest is nil. This ensures that when we create a new user, they have a valid password. The second validation ensures that when updating a user's password, the updated password is also six characters long. allow_blank: true skips the validation if no updated password is given. This allows us to change other attributes on a user without being forced to set the password

  # #6 use Ruby's has_secure_password. has_secure_password "adds methods to set and authenticate against a BCrypt password. This mechanism requires you to have a password_digest attribute". This function abstracts away much of the complexity of obfuscating user passwords using hashing algorithms which we would otherwise be inclined to write to securely save passwords. has_secure_password requires a  password_digest attribute on the model it is applied to. has_secure_password creates two virtual attributes, password and password_confirmation that we use to set and save the password
